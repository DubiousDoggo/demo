 - Variable Width Font Engine

    - Memory Constraints:
        - 64KB total RAM
        - minus zeropage, VIC, I/O, etc
        - ~175 pages of free memory for code and data

    - Tile Allocation:
        - For a 40 column by 3 row scroller: 120 tiles
        - Max of 256 tiles per tilemap
        - possible for each tile to have its own tile
        - wider area would need dynamic tile allocation - future project?

    - Kerning:
        - 26 letters ^2 for 676 letter pairs = ~3 pages of tables
