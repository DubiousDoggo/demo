;      .byte "aspect of economic organisation, the so-called royal economy imposed on the "
;      .byte "country by ptolemy ii [1]. both emphases have been directed by the nearly exclusive use of the greek papyri in constructing the historical narrative. we owe "
;      .byte "much of the basic picture of land-tenure in egypt during the hellenistic period "
;      .byte "to the influential work of michael rostovtzeff and claire preaux, scholars who "
;      .byte "both relied heavily on greek sources from the fayyum, among which the anon "
;      .byte "archive from philadelphia, dating to the third century bce, has occupied a prominent position [2]. the large number of documents illustrating the administration of "
;      .byte "a large estate granted by ptolemy ii philadelphus to one of his leading ministers can hardly be expected to offer a representative picture even for the fayyum. "
;      .byte "this was, in any case an unusual region in many respects and the emphasis on "
;      .byte "it has crowded out of the picture the nile valley and egyptian traditions of landholding, both of which are important aspects of any study of egypt as a whole "
;      .byte "under the ptolemies [3]. a better appreciation of the comparisons to be made "
;      .byte "between the evidence of the greek papyri and that of the demotic should allow "
;      .byte "us to redress the balance and to approach a description of the economy and society of ptolemaic egypt which will take account of the way in which institutions "
;      .byte "and practices appear in documents from two different social and linguistic "
;      .byte "traditions. "

;     .byte "rostovtzeff and those who have followed him have argued, or in some cases "

;     .byte "control of egypt's resources which, it is usually argued, was a tradition going "
;     .byte "back to the pharaohs. tight and efficient management of egypt's natural "
;     .byte "resources, and the elaborate taxation system placed upon these resources, in addition to a greatly increased degree of monetisation of the economy, stretched peasants and private economic activity to the point of breaking. such a scheme of "
;     .byte "state control of resources under the ptolemies is coming under increasing doubt "
;     .byte "as indeed it has for the pharaonic period as well [4]. that egypt was never as centrally, tightly, or uniformly managed as this argument holds is suggested by many "
;     .byte "general factors, not least the geography of the land and the nature of the long "

;     .byte "alter the local institutional structures in the rural nile valley but adapted to what "
;     .byte "was already in place, grafting new administrative mechanisms on to traditional "
;     .byte "rural structures? this contrasts sharply with the fayyum, where royal interest "
;     ; p.85    
;     .byte "was more direct and government impact more profound because of the reclamation project which was followed by new settlements, the influx of new populations and experimentation in new crops, not the least of which were the olive "
;     .byte "and a new strain of wheat (triticum durum)[7]. to describe merely the royal economy, then, is to describe only part of the picture of the land-tenure regime in "
;     .byte "hellenistic egypt. the symbiosis of old and new in hellenistic egypt allowed "
;     .byte "significafit private economic activity. there continued to be a variety of landholding patterns and, operating underneath the royal economy, village and "
;     .byte "regiod economies, what braudel has termed the infra-economy.8 such a scenario suggests something far from a monolithic state economy. how these local "
;     .byte "economies were tied into the 'national' economy is perhaps the least-explored "
;     .byte "area of hellenistic economic history. furthermore, if bingen is correct, greeks "
;     .byte "had less access to land than has previously been thought, the corollary of which "
;     .byte "is a greater engagement in other types of economic acti~ity.~ this is another coneast1 to the egyptian scene, where egyptians and others continued to work land "
;     .byte "in traditional modes. but even on kleruchic holdings, egyptian lessees played a "

;     .byte "that as it may, i argue in this paper that this degree of private control of real "
;     .byte "property was an important element in the local economies of the nile valley. in "
;     .byte "these documents there is almost always a temple context of the sales; parties "
;     .byte "involved had status on temple estates or were women who gained status through "
;     .byte "their husbands. very few cases survive of the transfer of land from parents to "
;     .byte "their children by means of conveyance, yet we know that children regularly "
;     .byte "inherited land from their parents, and had an expectation of doing so, not always "
;     .byte "without problems.'s that land was regularly handed down from parents to their "

;     .byte "frequently mention 'the land of so-and-so which is [now] in the possession of "
;     .byte "his children'. the explanation for the paucity of conveyance documents recording family transfers is that transfer normally occurred not through conveyances "
;     .byte "but by inheritance, the usual mechanism of which was a written marriage agreement between husband and wife which established the line of inheritance. if the "
;     .byte "land was held jointly by several siblings there may have been no need to draw "

;     .byte "preservation. but i believe there is a second factor which also accounts for the "
;     .byte "lack of records. if small-scale family landholding was predominant, with land "
;     .byte "often jointly held within a family, it would have been unnecessary to convey "

;     .byte "such conveyances record unusual transfers rather then the normal transfer of "

;     .byte "did occur and highlighted the tension between individual rights in real property "
;     .byte "and the desire to keep family land from fragmenting. since egyptians practised "
;     .byte "partible inheritance, further pressure on family property fragmentation was certainly exerted by the upward demographic trend in the hellenistic period.23 we "
;     .byte "can observe the result of this tension between individuals and the family unit in "
;     .byte "a famous family dispute over inheritance of real property in asyut in the second century bce. the dispute was over the inheritance of the ownership of two "
;     .byte "plots of land held by two half-brothers. the land was originally controlled jointly "
;     .byte "('without division', demotic ws'p$ and leased out. the phrase is often seen in2 "
;     .byte "the private legal papyri and indicates joint control, usually of family land. in the "
;     .byte "asyut dispute, the land, divided into two parcels, was inherited by two halfbrothers. at some point, we do not know exactly why (one of the brothers "
;     .byte "claimed he was being 'defrauded' and the ultimate tension may have been a "
;     .byte "problem in the division of the harvest from the land), a real division of the land "
;     .byte "was requested and a bitter court battle ensued, of which we have the verbatim "
;     .byte "record. the suit was brought by the eldest brother's wife on behalf of her chilrl "
;     .byte "dren to lay claim to the rights to both plots of land as the inheritance guaranteed to fall to her children by her marriage agreement. thus holding land as a "
;     .byte "family unit, while it made economic sense, may not always have reduced family tensions. such tension over the division of family land in part also derived "
;     .byte "from the tendency in egypt to divide the land into long narrow plots from the "

;     .byte "greeks may have been smaller, the ptolemies did have a continuing interest in "
;     .byte "upper egypt and over time more greeks (albeit, perhaps, defined by less rigorous ethnic criteria) settled in the valley. after the theban revolt was put down "

;     .byte "i have argued in this paper that the system of control under the ptolemies was "

;     .byte "throughout egypt. the ptolemies adapted in a practical manner to the realities "
;     .byte "of egypt. although they developed a large bureaucracy, its responses in exploiting the, countryside were to a great extent adaptive to existing local conditions "

;     .byte "past and continued under the ptolemies to be represented by the native temple "
;     .byte "and its landed estates. as in other parts of the hellenistic world, a multitude of "
;     .byte "diverse economic relationships continued to exist (including what amounted, in "
;     .byte "my view, to effective private ownership of real property) and regional differences continued to play an important role.74 within this regional diversity, i have "
